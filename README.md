##Before submitting a map

Please check the following points before adding new maps to this collection.

* Does the map work with the current development version?
 - In particular: Does it have a **start checkpoint**?
 - Does the map play well with the current impulse mechanics?
* Does the map come with a *mapname*.txt?
 - Does it provide a suitable license?
 - Does the license allow to share the map here?
 - Does it give proper attribution?
*  Is the map  **fun** to play? 
 - In contrast to the official maps, the race maps here do not have to be very polished.
 - Even an ugly looking map can be okay, if it offers something unique and interesting.
* Is there another version of this map? 
 - Be sure to give attribution to the source material for remixes and derivative work
 - If another version of a map is already available, does it differ in terms of game-play?
* Are the file sizes reasonable?
 - In particular: Is the light precision reasonably coarse?
 - Are there garbage or duplicate lines in *mapname*.cfg? 
 - If a map has no lightmaps, will it look better with basic lighting?
* Can the map easily be improved?
 - Are there shortcuts that need to be fixed?
 - If the path is difficult to find, what about adding some **route** entities?
 - Will some turrets make gauntlet-race games more exciting?
